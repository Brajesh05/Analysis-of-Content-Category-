# Content Analysis : Social Buzz 
An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

## Project Overview:
- This Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into the content popularity of a Social Media Company over the past year. By Analyzing various aspects of the content data, reaction data and reaction type. I seeked to identify trends, make data driven recommendation and gain a deeper understanding of company's performance.
- Over 100,000 posts per day. 
- Over 36,500,000 contents per year. 
- Identifying Top 5 Categories.

## Data Sources: 
- Content Data : The dataset used for this analysis is the "content_data.csv" file, containing the detailed information about the content being prefered by users.
- Reaction Data : The dataset used for this analysis is the "reaction_data.csv" file, containing the detailed information about the rection given for a particular type of content.
- Reaction_type Data : The dataset used for this analysis is the "Reaction_type.csv" file, containing the detailed information about type of reaction for particular content given by users. 

## Tools :
- Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis, Charts. 
- Powerpoint - Presentation

## Data Cleaning : 
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & inspection.
2. Handeling the missing values.
3. Cleaning the duplicates.
4. Data cleaning & Formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the Content Data to Answer key questions, such as:
- What is overall Reacction trend?
- Which content is most popular?
- Which content is least popular?
- What % split of popularity between the top 5 categories?
- Which type of content people want to see?
- No.of Unique categories?

## Process :
- Data Understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and domain of the business.
- Data Cleaning -  after understanding the business, I then cleaned the available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for this problem.
- Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the business questions and produce the results needed.
-  Data analysis - With the new dataset, I used my analytical expertise to uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the insights.
-  Uncover Insights - finally we used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.

## Data Analysis :
``` Excel
1) VLOOKUP( ) - function to connect the tables from different workbooks.
2) SUMIF()    - function to get the top 5 categories of content.
3) Chart      - Bar chart & Pie chart (To present the popular categories).
```

## Result/ Insights :
1) From the analysis, I can see that the top 5 most popular categories of posts were animals, science, healthy eating, technology and food in descending order.
2) Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965. I found that animals and science are the two most popular categories, suggesting that users like "real-life" and "factual" content.
3) It is very interesting to see both food and healthy eating within the top 5, it really shows that food is a highly engaging content category. Healthy eating ranks slightly 
higher than food, so perhaps user base may be skewed towards healthy eaters and health-conscious people.
4)  In business terms, this could suggest that the most popular category, animals, 
is tailing away from the rest of the categories and may continue to get more and 
more popular. To avoid an issue where 1 content category consumes the entire 
platform, it will be important for company to ensure that any algorithms used to 
govern the content on the platform gives a fair balance to the content categories.

## Recommendations :
1) Focus on expanding and promoting other categories. 
2) As we have seen that healthy eating is the popular category so company can run a campaign with content focused on this categories or work with healthy eating brands to promote content.
